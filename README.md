## Please pay attention here!.


I updated everything except get_navigation and get_connect and wrote proper documentation for the rest. The upgrade to the latest SDK version is done. You need to create a package with the latest SDK version, take the codes from my kit and import them into the SDK package, and then merge the new package in Git.
